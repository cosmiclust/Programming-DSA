/* To avoid this redundancy of code, we use functions or methods.

A function is a block of code that executes when called 
and that does a particular task whenever you call it. A function is always written inside a class.

In java, there are 2 kinds of functions :

User-Defined Functions - These are the ones we create based on our requirements.
Standard Library Functions - The functions are already defined in Java Libraries,
you can directly use them in your programs. For example : str.length() would give you the length of string str.

*  The first line i.e. public static int f ( int n ) is called a function signature.
*  The int here is the return type of the function.
*  A function can return anything as output, it can be an integer(int), decimal number(float), a string and even nothing (void).4
*  **A function can receive any number of inputs of the same or different data types.**
*  If a function doesn't receive any input, then we leave those brackets empty. The inputs in Java are called parameters.
