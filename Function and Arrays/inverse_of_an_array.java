/* given a number n, representing the size of array a,
followed by n numbers, representing elements of array a.

You are required to calculate the inverse of array a. 
Since input and output are already managed, your only work is 
to code a function that will return the user a new array with inverted values. */

/* The basic concept of the problem is to change the positions of the
values as their indices and indices as values using a for loop and a new array of the same length as that of the input array's length . */
