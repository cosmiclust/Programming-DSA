/* In Java, string is an object that represents an array or a sequence of characters. 

A character (char) is a primitive-data type, 
whereas string in java is actually a non-primitive data type, because it refers to an object.

The String object has methods that are used to perform certain operations on strings.

Name of the data type used to declare a string is "String" and not "string".
